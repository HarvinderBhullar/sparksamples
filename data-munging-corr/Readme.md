###Correlation between current vs Pressure, Humidity and Temperature

*  Corr between Current vs Temperature for Lathe Machine: -0.0022355355586013534
*  Corr between Current vs Pressure for Lathe Machine: 0.002478378555521012
*  Corr between Current vs Humidity for Lathe Machine: -0.0011520884393139818


####Conclusion

Current is correlated with Temp and Pressure to some extent. It  inversely  varies with Temp and proportional to Pressure.
